# tinydiffusion
Simple Diffusion Implementations for Educational Purposes. These are restricted to image based data for now.

### Setup
```bash
# install env with uv (lightning fast!)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- [ ] DDPM
- [ ] SDLM
- [ ] Flow Matching (And Stochastic Interpolants)
- [ ] Inductive Moment Matching
